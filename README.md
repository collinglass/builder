# builder

Builder pattern written in Go.


## Use as Reference Only

Since builders are used to make useful things, this package is basically useless other than as a reference for implementing ```Builder``` pattern in Go.

Maybe in the future I'll turn this into a framework or a skeleton to write builders but for now, use it only as a reference point.

#### Default Builder

Used for testing and example code.
